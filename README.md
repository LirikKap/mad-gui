## How do I get the GUI to work on my machine?
In the next section, we present two options how to obtain and run the GUI.
However, this will only enable you to look at our example data.
You want to load data of a specific format/system or want to use a specific algorithm? 
In this case please refer to [Can I use it with data of my specific system or a specific algorithm?](#can-i-use-it-with-data-of-my-specific-system-or-a-specific-algorithm)

### How can I test the GUI using your example data on my computer?

First, you need to download the example data.
Click on [this link](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/raw/main/example_data/sensor_data.zip), and extract the file to your computer.
If you also want to check out synchronization with a video file, click on [this link](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.1/video.mp4) and save it on your machine. Next, use one of the following two options (for testing it on Windows, we recommend Option A).

#### End-user: Standalone executable

When downloading the files below, your browser may warn you that this is a potentially dangerous file.
You will only be able to use our GUI by selecting "Keep anyway / download anyway / ...".
In the case of Microsoft Edge, this possiblity is hidden, but you can select it after downloading as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions#user-experience-for-downloads-lacking-gestures).

Start the program, and then you can open the previously downloaded example data as shown in [How do I use it (videos)?](#how-do-i-use-it-videos)

#### Developers: Using the python package

Info: We recommend to use `pip install mad_gui` in a [clean python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) / [conda environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments). 
This way you do NOT need to clone this github repository.
Afterwards, you can simply start our GUI from your terminal:

```
pip install mad_gui
mad-gui
```

Alternatively, within a python script use our [start_gui](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/mad_gui/mad_gui.start_gui.html#mad_gui.start_gui) function: 

```
from mad_gui import start_gui
start_gui()
```

Now you can open the previously downloaded example data as shown in [How do I use it (videos)?](#how-do-i-use-it-videos)

## Can the GUI load and display data of my specific system?
Yes, however it will need someone who is familiar with Python. For more information, please refer to [Developing Plugins](#developing-plugins).
You do not have experience with python but still want to load data from a specific system? [Contact us!](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de)

## Can the GUI use my own algorithm?
Yes, however it will need someone who is familiar with Python. For more information, please refer to [Developing Plugins](#developing-plugins).
You do not have experience with python but still want to load data from a specific system? [Contact us!](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de)

## Can I change something at the core of the GUI?
Yes, for more information, please [get in touch](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de).

## Developing Plugins
The MaD GUI package is a framework, which can be extended with different kinds of plugins and labels.
The user can access your plugins within the GUI using dropdowns, after clicking "Load data" or "Use algorithm". 
**However, this is only possible if your plugin was passed to the GUI at startup**:

```python
from mad_gui import start_gui
from my_importer import MyImporter
from my_algorithm import MyAlgorithm
from my_labels import MyFirstLabel, MySecondLabel

# only passing plugins
start_gui(plugins=[MyImporter, MyAlgorithm])

# passing plugins and labels
start_gui(plugis=[MyImporter], labels=[MyFirstLabel, MySecondLabel])

```

In the sections in the following list we describe how you can develop your own plugins and labels, which must inherit one of our 
[base plugins](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/plugins.html#plugins) or 
[BaseRegionLabel](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/plot_tools/mad_gui.plot_tools.labels.BaseRegionLabel.html#mad_gui.plot_tools.labels.BaseRegionLabel).
**Each of these sections keeps working example to get you started as quick as possible**:

   - Importer: [Load and display data of a specific system](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_importer.html#importer)
   - Algorithm: [Create annotations for plotted data](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_algorithm.html#algorithm)
   - Algorithm: [Calculate features for existing annotations](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_algorithm.html#algorithm)
   - Exporter: [Export displayed annotations](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_exporter.html)
   - Labels: [Create one or several custom label classes](file:///D:/mad-gui/docs/_build/html/labels.html#labels)
   - For supplementary basic information please refer to [Preparation](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guidelines.html).

## Communicating with the user

If - at any point - you want to send a message to the user of the GUI, you create a message box with an OK button like
this:

```python
from mad_gui.components.dialogs.user_information import UserInformation

UserInformation.inform_user("Your message")

# will return PySide2.QtWidgets.QMessageBox.Yes or PySide2.QtWidgets.QMessageBox.No
yes_no = UserInformation().ask_user("Yes or No?") 
```

## Changing the theme

You can easily change the two dominating colors by passing your own theme to the GUI.

```python
   from mad_gui import start_gui
   from mad_gui.config import BaseTheme
   from PySide2.QtGui import QColor

   class MyTheme(BaseTheme):
      COLOR_DARK = QColor(0, 255, 100)
      COLOR_LIGHT = QColor(255, 255, 255)

   start_gui(
    theme=MyTheme,
   )
```

## Adjusting Constants

You can create your own settings by creating a class, which inherits from our [BaseSettings](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/blob/main/mad_gui/config/settings.py#L1)>`_.
The following example makes use of the BaseSettings and simply overrides some properties:

```python
from mad_gui.config import BaseSettings
from mad_gui import start_gui
   
class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    CHANNELS_TO_PLOT = ["acc_x", "acc_z"]
    
    # used if a label has `snap_to_min = True` or `snap_to_max = True`
    SNAP_AXIS = "acc_x"
    SNAP_RANGE_S = 0.2
    
    # in all your labels you can add an event by using `Ctrl` as modifier when in `Add label` mode
    # when adding an event the user will be prompted to select one of these two strings as a
    # `description` for the event
    EVENTS = ["important event", "other type of important event"]
    
    # Set the width of IMU plot to this, when hitting the play button for the video.
    PLOT_WIDTH_PLAYING_VIDEO = 20  # in seconds
    
    # If plotting large datasets, this speeds up plotting, however might result in inaccurate
    # representation of the data
    AUTO_DOWNSAMPLE = True

start_gui(
settings=MySettings,
)

```
