##  What is it?
The MaD GUI is a framework for processing time series data.
Its use-cases include visualization, annotation (manual or automated), and algorithmic processing of visualized data and annotations.

## How do I use it?
### Videos
By clicking on the images below, you will be redirected to YouTube. In case you want to follow along on your own machine, check out the section [How do I get the GUI to work on my machine?](#how-do-i-get-the-gui-to-work-on-my-machine) first.

### Shortcuts
Please watch the videos linked above, if you want to learn more about the different actions.

| Shortcut <img width=50/>                     | Mode <img width=50/>          | Action |
|------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| `a`, `e`, `r`, `s`, `Esc`    | all           | Switch between modes *Add label*, *Edit label*, *Remove label*, *Synchronize data*|
| `Left Mouse Click`           | Add label     | Set start/end of a label|
| `Space`                      | Add label     | Can be used instead of `Left Mouse Click` |
| `1`, `2`, `3`,... `TAB`      | Add label     | Navigate in the pop-up window |
| `Shift` + `Left Mouse Click` | Add label     | Start a new label directly when setting the end of a label |
| `Ctrl` + `Left Mouse Click`  | Add label     | Add a single event |

## How do I get the GUI to work on my machine?
In the next section, we present two options how to obtain and run the GUI.
However, this will only enable you to look at our example data.
You want to load data of a specific format/system or want to use a specific algorithm? 
In this case please refer to [Can I use it with data of my specific system or a specific algorithm?](#can-i-use-it-with-data-of-my-specific-system-or-a-specific-algorithm)

### How can I test the GUI using your example data on my computer?

First, you need to download the example data.
Click on [this link](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/raw/main/example_data/sensor_data.zip), and extract the file to your computer.
If you also want to check out synchronization with a video file, click on [this link](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.1/video.mp4) and save it on your machine. Next, use one of the following two options (for testing it on Windows, we recommend Option A).

#### Option A: Standalone executable

When downloading the files below, your browser may warn you that this is a potentially dangerous file.
You will only be able to use our GUI by selecting "Keep anyway / download anyway / ...".
In the case of Microsoft Edge, this possiblity is hidden, but you can select it after downloading as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions#user-experience-for-downloads-lacking-gestures).

| Operating system <img width=200/>      | File to download <img width=200/>| What to do                                        |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Windows                | [Windows (64 bit)](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.1/mad_gui)       | Download the file on the left. Then open the ownloaded file. <br /> <br />*Note: If prompted with a dialog `Windows protected your PC`, click `More info` and then select `Run anyway`* |
| Ubuntu                 | [Ubuntu (64 bit)](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.5/mad_gui_ubuntu) | Download the file on the left. Then, in your terminal, navigate to the file loaction and then: `chmod +x ./mad_gui_ubuntu` and then `./mad_gui_ubuntu` <br /> <br />*Note: you might need to install some additional packages. You can use [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/main/unix_dependencies.sh) to do so. Just right click the link, save it on your machine and execute it.*|
| Mac OS                 | [Mac OS (64 bit)](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.5/mad_gui_mac.zip) | Download the file on the left and extract it. Then, in your [terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-lk/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac), navigate to the location where you extracted "mad_gui_mac.app" to. Then type `chmod +x ./mad_gui_mac.app` and then `./mad_gui_mac.app` <br /><br /> *Note: If your Mac does not allow you to open this file, perform the actions for "If you want to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer" on the [Apple Support Page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491). Afterwards, try `./mad_gui_mac.exe` again in your terminal.*|

Start the program and then you can open the previously downloaded example data as shown in [How do I use it (videos)?](#how-do-i-use-it-videos)

#### Option B: Using the python package

Info: We recommend to use `pip install mad_gui` in a [clean python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) / [conda environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments). This way you do NOT need to clone this github repository.

```
pip install mad_gui
python -m mad_gui.start_gui
```

Alternatively, within a python script use our [start_gui](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/mad_gui/mad_gui.start_gui.html#mad_gui.start_gui) function: 

```
from mad_gui import start_gui
start_gui()
```

Now you can open the previously downloaded example data as shown in [How do I use it (videos)?](#how-do-i-use-it-videos)

## Can the GUI load and display data of my specific system?
Yes, however it will need someone who is familiar with python.
This person needs to perform the steps described in [Development](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html).
Some supplementary basic information can be found in our section [Prepare Development](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guidelines.html).

You do not have experience with python but still want to load data from a specific system? [Contact us!](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de)


## Can the GUI use my own algorithm?

## Can I change something at the core of the GUI?
Yes, for more information, please take a look at our [Contribution Guidelines](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guidelines.html#contribution-guidelines).
